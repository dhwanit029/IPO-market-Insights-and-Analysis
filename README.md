- Examine factors influencing IPO success such as industry, age, size, market conditions  
- Provide interactive visualizations and reports for decision making  
- Demonstrate full-cycle analytics skills: **SQL → Python → BI**

Key Insights

- IPOs in high-growth sectors showed greater listing premiums and stronger price appreciation.

- Smaller/mid-cap IPOs often out-performed large-cap ones in first 6-12 months due to higher growth expectations.

- Timing of IPO relative to market cycle had a large impact on performance.

- Pre-issue financial health (revenue growth, margin) and promoter reputation correlated with better post-listing performance.

- Visualising regional and sectoral clustering revealed pockets of undervalued IPOs emerging.
